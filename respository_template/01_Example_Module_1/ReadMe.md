# Example Module 1

This document provides some guidance on the information required when uploading a new resource or model to the Github. 

## Introduction
- What is this project or module about? 
- What background does the user need to know? This should include the language, date it was created, by whom,

## Objective
What does this Module do? This should include information on why the model was created, its original intent.
I need to highlight these **very important words**.

This contains two sections
1. 


## 1. Information about the model {#model-info}
### Data/Inputs
What input data is needed for this module - remember do not store data on GitHub!
* Include links and source
* Explain the quality of data


You may want to use a table to present this information. These are not compulsory


| Data              | Quality and year last updated | Source |
| :---------------- | :------: | ----: |
| Data source 1 (e.g. National Buildings Database)       |   Good , 2024  | Report[^1] |
| Data source 2 (e.g. data collected as part of the project          |   Good  , 2024 | Can be found in ERT OneDrive  |
|  Data from reference documents |  Average, 2020 and 2015   | Link|
| Data source 4 |  2024 good data quality   | Link |

## Assumptions
Provide a list or table of key assumptions underpinning the model or analysis.

| Assumption        | Value/Relationship     | Source|
| :-----------------| :--------------------: | -----:|
| e.g. Cooking fuel in homes is electric | No gas meter connection in homes without gas boiler | CODE Methodology Report |


### How the model works
Please provide a brief explanaiton of how the model/module works.

Please address the following points.
* What language was it written in
* When it was last updated
This could include a diagram (example below).

1) Input refers to the input data. You can find this data at [this example link](https://www.example.com). 
2) Model contains three scripts, which you can read more about in the [section below](#file-description). The main script is called `main.py`, and calls the other scripts and produces the outputs.
3) Outputs contains an example output which could be generated by running the model with the default input options.

### Files include {#file-description}
* Input.py
* `Main.py`: runs all the scripts
* `CleanInputData.py`: cleans all the input data and prepares it so it can be used in functions
* `Functions.py`: gathers all the relevant functions



## How to use this model

### Steps to run this model
To run this model, please follow the next steps
1. Create a local copy on CBAS
2. Read the ReadMe
3. In `main.py` change the folder location to refer to the location where you have saved the model
4. Download the input data from here:
5. Downlaod the output data from here:
6. Run the model by clicking "Run Script".

### Relevant information

What specific information would be required for a new user? 
how is the model maintained?
What date was it written?
What were caveats and limitations at the time?

## How to run the code
You may want to include a snippet of code that users may need to use to load/run the analysis, or then describe the sequence of steps needed. For example for a model written in R you may provide a list of libraries and scripts to load:

``` Rscript
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2)
source('core_model_functions.R')
```
