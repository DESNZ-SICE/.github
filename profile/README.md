# Welcome to the SICE Github
SICE (Science & Innovation for Climate and Energy) is a Directorate with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.

This organisation exists to share models and scripts used for data analysis. Public repositories should not contain any sensitive parameters or data: all data should be stored locally or in a secure manner. 

We will be developing our own standards for best coding practices, but for now will point towards the MOJ's guidance for https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/our-coding-standards?
